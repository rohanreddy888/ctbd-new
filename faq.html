    <div class="faq card">
  <h4 style="color:#039BE5;">HOW DO WE RECOGNIZE THIS PROBLEM IN A CHILD?</h4>
  <p>This makes the child very weak and unable to do many activities that are normal for a healthy child. Activities that need physical exertion like active play are affected. He / she becomes irritable and cries at the smallest pretext. As the child grows even concentrating on academic activities are affected. The child’s tummy becomes protuberant as the spleen becomes abnormally big.</p>

<h4 style="color:#039BE5;">IS IT A NEW PROBLEM IN OUR COMMUNITIES?</h4>
<p>Thalassemia is the most common single gene disorder across the world. It is more common among the people living in the Mediterranean region. The problem is not new to us in India but we certainly are becoming more aware as we have access to improving the quality of the lives of the affected children. It is seen more commonly among people.</p>

</div>
<div class="faq card">
<h4 style="color:#039BE5;">WHY SHOULD HEALTHY PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THIS PROBLEM?</h4>
<p>People who are Thalassemia carriers are otherwise healthy and  lead normal active lives. The problem arises when two carriers have children. In a way this problem lies hidden until two carriers marry. As these healthy individuals carry the abnormal gene, they lead normal lives including becoming Parents. It is therefore important to become aware and reduce the risks to the next generations. Many come to know that they are carriers only after they have child with a major form of Thalassemia

</h4>
<p>No it is not possible to diagnose a carrier through routine testing. On must ask for Thalassemia screening test to detect a carrier. Specific testing using techniques with great precision are required. Currently recommended method is called HPLC for separation of Hemoglobin types. It is advisable to have this testing done with a reputed laboratory physician.

<div class="faq card">
<h4 style="color:#039BE5;">HOW MUCH BLOOD WILL BE NEEDED TO DO THIS TEST BE NEEDED TO DO THIS TEST AND WHERE IS IT DONE?</h4>

<h4 style="color:#039BE5;">WHO SHOULD BE SCREENED FOR THALASSAEMIA CARRIER STATUS?
</h4>
<p>Anyone who is a potential parent - which practically means all, are eligible for screening. Premarital screening is a wise step that can help avoid marriage between carriers. Screening of pregnant women gives another opportunity to detect before disaster strikes the family.

</h4>
<p>We could change the profile of the future generations with respect to Thalassemia by being part of awareness programmes, by getting ourselves and our children screened. We could advocate screening every time there is an opportunity we could donate blood that is life saving for the affected children. We could share this information with others.
